# MOQ1000

:memo: This is a migration rule for v4 and prior versions.

## Cause

The `Moq<T>` type has been replaced by direct usage of `Moq.Of<T>`, which returns an instance of `T`.

## Rule description

All `Mock<T>` operations such as `Setup` and `Returns` have been replaced with corresponding extension 
methods on the `T` instance itself, so `Moq.Of<T>` should be used exclusively. 

Yes, this means `mock.Object` is gone. Yay :)

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, apply the provided code fix, or manually replace usage of `new Mock<T>` 
with `Mock.Of<T>`.


## How to suppress violations

This rule should not be suppressed since Moq v5+ does not support the `Mock<T>` API at all and will throw 
run-time exceptions.
